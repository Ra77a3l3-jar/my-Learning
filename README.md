## 📁 What's Inside

### Core Practice
Fundamental exercises across multiple languages—building intuition for syntax, paradigms, and problem-solving patterns. From basic control flow to complex data structures.

### Systems & Low-Level
Exploring how things work under the hood. Memory management, pointers, compilation, system programming concepts. Learning by breaking things and figuring out why.

### Algorithms & Problem Solving
Classic computer science problems, data structure implementations, and algorithmic challenges. Practice makes permanent.

### Projects & Experiments
- **Mini Tools** - Command-line utilities and helpers
- **Prototypes** - Testing ideas and concepts
- **Code Challenges** - Various platform exercises
- **Learning Projects** - Hands-on exploration of new topics

This repository captures my daily coding practice 💡—a mix of structured exercises, experimental code, and small projects. Some implementations are clean and optimized, others are rough drafts full of learning moments. Each commit represents hands-on problem-solving and continuous improvement 🚀.
